ζῆ Tur favour shown by the publio to a preceding edition in
' ‘ the‘present‘ form, has induoed the editor, on a revision, to
tiss· his best endeavours to make it less unworthy of the
approbation which it has had the good fortune to receive.
'l'he text previously followed was that of the edition deserv·
edly in high esteem, prepared for the press hythe labours
of John Michael Heusinger, and of his nephevv‚ Jacob Ere·
derio Heusinger; published at Brunswioh‚ after the death
of the latter, by his son, Conrad.
As early as the year 1749, John Michael had announeed
his intention of editing the Offioes: within two or three
⁸ years after, on his death, his materials fell into the hands
of Jacob hederis, a man of sound judgment‚ unwearied
industry, and well skilled in every department of classic
' lore. To this work he devoted his attention for a number
of years, and hythe possession of seveml MSS. before un·
examined‚ was enabled to veri'fy‚ and to make, numerous
emendations. Since the publication of that edition in 1783,
no material improvement of the text, though frequently re·
printed in different countries, appears to have been attempted
till 1811, when a new critical edition was given at Leipsie,
by Aug. Gotth. Gernbard, with a reprint of fasciolati’s
notes, and the addition of a valuable body of others, pre·
pared by the editor himself.
- 'l'hough the Heusingers' edition has been taken as the
basis oi the present, Gemhard’s hasbeen most oaxeixhhs
