PREFACE.

'Pur favour shown by the public to a preceding edition in
the present form, has induced the editor, on a revision, to

his intention of editing the Ofiioes: within two or three
years after, on his death, his materials fell into the hands

of years, and by the possession of several MSS. before un·
examinem was enabled to verify‚ and to make, numerous
emendations. Since the publication of that edition in 1783,

printed in different countries‚ appears to have been attempted
till 1811, when a new critical edition was given at Leipsie,

notes, and the addition of a valuable body of others, pre-
