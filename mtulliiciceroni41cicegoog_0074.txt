otium! Ita consiliis diligentiaque nostra celeriter de
manibus audacissimorum civium delapsa arma ipsa†
ceciderunt. Quae res igitur gesta umquam iu bello
tantal qui triumphus conferendus?

Licet enim milri, Marce fili, apud te gloriari,‡ ad
quem et hereditas hujus gloriae,§ et sactorum imitatio
pertinet. Mihi quidem certe vir abundans bellicis lau·
dibus On. Pompeius, multis audientibus, hoc tribuit, ut
diceret, frustra se triumphum tertiumll deportaturum
fnisse, nisi meo in rempublicam beneficio, ubi trium
pharet, esset habiturus. Sunt igitur domestica fortitu
dines non inferiores militaribus : inquibus plus ctiam,
qnam in his, operae studiique ponendum est.

*Otium Odium, which seems the most robable reading,is
found in many MSS„ though not preferred hythe Heusingers.

† hiae. In many MSS. this pronoun does not appear3 in one,
ipa.- this favours a previous happy conjecturo of the younger Gro-
novius, that this word should be impio. Thus: erepublica, aroris

'milui’ apopprgailtfflouppe ppiibesiiiiinhhd disin· lapportunity, is
taken yCicero‚ of paying to his own conduct unng his consu·
lete, most extravagant compliments, apparently very little merited.
When a magistrate takes on himself to executa his fellow citizens,
unheard and without trial, he needs some better justification than
aelf-gratulahon, or the applauses of those of his own party. lt

is difficolt to assign any justification for pultinp to deat the infe·
rior agents in a conspiracy, at a moment when t cy were eculiarly
under the protection of the laws, and when nothing conl be feared
florii them personally3 whilst a formidabis party at the same mo·
ment was suffered to collect in anns, to enlist men, it would seem,
without o position3 and their leader, even enrouragad to join
them. Aller the rebellion was quelled, no pains seem to have been
taken hythe senate, either to remove the causes of the ublic dis-
contents‚ or to reform their constitution, ill adaptcd, or ralla totally
unfit, for the circumstances in which multiplied conquests had
placed them. Another rebellion, still more formidable, speedily
arose, in which their re ublic, as might have been expected. was
eompletel overwhelme . llad the party prevailed‚ of which Pom·
pey was t leader, the event would not have been different.
